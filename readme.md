## Introduction
We aim to develop an agent that is capable of effectively playing the game Galaga.  The agent will be in control of a spaceship in a boxed, continuous environment.  

Galaga is a non-turn-based video game that consists of a single player agent and several enemies that spawn indefinitely until the game is over. The objective of the game is to dodge incoming projectiles from enemies while simultaneously launching projectiles at enemies to destroy them and achieve the highest possible score.
